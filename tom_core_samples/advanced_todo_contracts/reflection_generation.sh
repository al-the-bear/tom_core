# Why no baked-in SDK path: the fleet's hosts install Dart in different places,
# so any absolute default is wrong on most of them and fails with a bare "no
# such file or directory" quoting a path the reader has never seen. Failing
# loudly, with the remedy in the message, is cheaper than guessing.
